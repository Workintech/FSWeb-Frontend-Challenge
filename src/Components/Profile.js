        <p>During my educational journey within the discipline of mechanical engineering and in the subsequent period, I developed projects using Arduino, Ansys, and SolidWorks.</p>
        <p>Later on, I pursued training in web development and began utilizing JavaScript, React, and Node.js technologies. As I delved deeper, software development evolved into a passion for me. Now, I have made the decision to align this passion with my career goals. I am dedicated to working a bit harder every day to achieve success.
